redox-tween
===========

*This repository contains code that has not been properly tested yet, continue
at the risk of doing stupid things while discovering parts of this library
don't work.*

## Introduction

Games and other applications often have a need to change values smoothly,
without the need for a fully-blown physics system. This is where
[Tweening][wikipedia] (Inbe **tween** ing) comes in. It allows to interpolate
between numerical values in a lightweight way.

[This YouTube video][youtube-juice] is an interesting example of how the
addition of animations (via tweens) can change the feeling of a game.

## Example

See <src/examples>.

Compiling and running `images.rs` *should* create `.ppm` files of all basic
variations of tweens in `/tmp/`. If that directory doesn't exit for you, you
should change the hardcoded path. (Yes, it should be an argument)

More complex examples will follow.


## Features

- Allows tweening of any type (via traits)
- Multiple easing equations:
 - Linear
 - Quad
 - Cubic
 - Quart
 - Quint
 - Sine
 - Circular
 - Back
 - Elastic
 - Bounce
- Easy to add own equations
- Easing modes `In`, `Out` and `InOut`
- Tween organization:
 - Sequential execution
 - Parallel execution
 - Pauses
 - Function execution
 - Repeated execution
- Three value access modes
 - via unsafe pointers
 - via `Cell`
 - via callback functions

## Todo

- Direct `task` launching
- Making tweens `Send`able?

an overview of different easings. Note that `Expo` is not implemented at time
of writing.
